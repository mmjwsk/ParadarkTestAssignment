# Sample Test Assignment

## Assignment description

Create a new Unreal Engine 5.4 project.

Features:
- Ranged weapon shooting projectiles (you may use the first person template for this)
- 4 ammunition types: Regular (deals damage), Fire (deals fire damage and applies
on fire effect to the target), Water (puts out flames and cancels on fire effects),
Healing (heals the target). You donâ€™t need to add particle effects, changing colors of
assets is enough.
- On fire effect: deals fire damage periodically to the target, expires after some time by
itself or by water.
- Damage system with multiple types and resistances to each one
- Health displaying over actors (basic UI or debug draws are enough)

## Solution Details

### Damage Types and ammunition
In completing the assignment I focused the most on the extensibility aspect of it - with designers in mind. The system allows for easy and seamless addition of new damage types and new damage resistances that can fill a distinct gameplay niche. Each new Damage Type can operate independantly from others or have interactions with them - everything is defined in a matter of few clicks. In order to demonstrate that, I added another damage type - Poison - following the design rules:
- After a short delay (onset) rapidly depletes health by small values (to differentiate from Fire effect that depletes health every second by larger values, without the initial delay)
- Can be stopped by Healing projectile (similarly to how Water stops Fire effect)

Adding a new, fully funcional damage type (or damage cancellation type) takes about a 2 minutes, then it works seamlessly. The list of steps:
- Adding an Enum value in DamageEnums.h to represent the new damage type
- Handling input for it - Creating corresponding InputAction and adding it to the Mapping Context IMC_DamageTypes
- Creating a projectile asset for the new damage type
- Mapping the projectile to the new DamageType Enum in DA_DamageSettings->ProjectilesForDamageTypes
- Mapping the input to the new DamageType Enum in DA_DamageSettings->DamageTypeInputs

### Damage Resistances and targets
In order to demonstrate the damage interactions, target cubes have been placed on the scene. They have a health display hovering above and follow the set of rules:
- White cube - basic target. No resistances / modifications.
- Red cube - Fire-vulnerable cube. Severely reduced Basic & Poison damage, regular Fire damage.
- Green cube - Poison-vulnerable cube. Severely reduced Basic & Fire damage, double Poison damage.
- Black cube - "Undead rules" cube. Reduced Basic & Fire damage. Healing damages the cube, Poison heals the cube.

Adding a new type of target is even easier than adding a new type of damage - all it takes is creating a child BP from BP_BaseTarget and editing the values of DamageResistane within its DamageSystemComponent.

### Project organization
I've made sure to keep my own code separate from the FPP template code, so there's no need to scour that code for anything added/modified by me. The only changes there was making about 2 methods virtual in order to override them in children classes. The entirety of the C++ code created for this assignment is located in the Public/Private folders of the solution (as opposed to the Unreal starter code that's just loose in the main Majewski_TestTask project folder). As for Editor stuff and assets, all of those created by me are located in the TestTaskAssets folder - everything else is the starter content and has not been subject to any changes.

### Controls
After picking up the gun, use numeric keys 1 to 5 to switch between damage types:
- 1 - Basic Damage - white projectile
- 2 - Fire Damage - red projectile
- 3 - Water Damage - blue projectile
- 4 - Healing Damage - green projectile
- 5 - Poison Damage - toxic-green projectile

The rest is as in the regular FPP project - WSAD to walk, space to jump, LMB to shoot
